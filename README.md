Run the command python3 tic_tac_toe.py to start the game.
The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid. Players take turns entering their mark (X or O) on the board by specifying the row and column numbers.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
